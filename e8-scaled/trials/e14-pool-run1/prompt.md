# Task: Fix bugs in a 13-module Beagle inventory system

You have a large inventory & order management system (13 modules, ~8500 LOC) written in Beagle (a typed language that compiles to Clojure). The code has bugs. Your job is to fix ALL bugs so the behavioral verification script passes (484 assertions).


# Beagle — full agent reference

Beagle is a statically typed language that compiles to Clojure. Files are
`.rkt` with `#lang beagle`. You probably know Clojure — Beagle is Clojure
with a type checker bolted on. Same data structures, same stdlib, same
runtime. The differences are all compile-time.

## What's different from Clojure

### Type annotations

```racket
(defn total [(qty : Long) (price : Long)] : Long
  (* qty price))
```

Params are wrapped: `(name : Type)`. Return type after the param vector.
Untyped params are allowed but the checker treats them as `Any`.

### Records

```racket
(defrecord Product [(id : Long) (name : String) (price : Long)])
```

This generates:
- Constructor: `(->Product 1 "Widget" 500)` typed `[Long String Long -> Product]`
- Accessors: `(product-id p)`, `(product-name p)`, `(product-price p)`
- Keyword access: `(:name p)` returns `String` when the checker knows `p` is `Product`
- Typed update: `(with p [:price 600])` — checks field existence AND field type

**Use `with`, not `assoc`.** `assoc` works at runtime but the checker can't
validate it. `with` catches wrong field names and wrong types at compile time.

**Use accessors, not `get`.** `(get product :name)` returns `Any`. `(product-name product)` returns `String`. Same for `(:name product)`.

### Nominal scalars (newtypes)

```racket
(defscalar Amount Long)
;; (->Amount 500)       — wrap a Long into an Amount
;; (amount-value a)     — unwrap Amount back to Long
```

Amount ≠ Long at compile time. You MUST unwrap before arithmetic and
rewrap after:

```racket
;; WRONG — checker rejects: expected Long, got Amount
(+ a b)

;; RIGHT
(->Amount (+ (amount-value a) (amount-value b)))
```

The error message `expected Long, got Amount` always means you forgot to unwrap.

### require imports everything

```racket
(require catalog :as cat)
;; cat/find-product, cat/Product, cat/->Product — all imported and typed
```

You do NOT need `declare-extern` for cross-module Beagle calls. Ever.
`declare-extern` is only for Java interop and non-Beagle namespaces.
Adding it for a Beagle function shadows the real imported type and causes
false type errors.

### cond accepts both styles

```racket
;; Bracketed
(cond [(> x 0) "pos"] [(< x 0) "neg"] [true "zero"])

;; Flat (Clojure-style)
(cond (> x 0) "pos" (< x 0) "neg" :else "zero")
```

Both are fully type-checked.

### for returns a Vec, doseq returns nil

```racket
(for [x coll] (process x))     ;; (Vec ResultType)
(doseq [x coll] (process x))   ;; Nil — side-effects only
```

### let bindings infer types

```racket
(let [x (find-product id)] ...)     ;; x : Product, inferred from RHS
(let [{:keys [name]} product] ...)  ;; name : String, from record fields
```

Don't annotate unless narrowing a union:
```racket
(let [(x : Product) (find-item id)] ...)  ;; only when find-item returns (U Product Service)
```

## Types

Primitives: `String`, `Long`, `Double`, `Boolean`, `Keyword`, `Nil`, `Any`

```
[A B -> R]           function type
[A & T -> R]         variadic
(Vec T)              vector
(Map K V)            map
(Set T)              set
(U String Long)      union
String?              nullable (= (U String Nil))
```

## All expressions

```racket
(if cond then else)
(cond [test body] ... [true fallback])
(when cond body...)
(do body1 body2 ... bodyN)
(let [name val ...] body...)
(loop [name init ...] body...)
(recur arg1 arg2 ...)
(for [x coll :when pred] body...)
(doseq [x coll] body...)
(fn [params] body...)
(try body... (catch ExType e handler...) (finally cleanup...))
(case val k1 r1 k2 r2 default)
(match expr [pattern body...] ...)
(-> x (f) (g))
(->> x (f) (g))
(:key map)
[item1 item2 ...]
{k1 v1 k2 v2}
#{item1 item2}
(unsafe "raw clojure")
```

## Parameters

```racket
[(x : Long) (y : String)]           typed
[x y z]                              untyped
[{:keys [name age]}]                 map destructuring
[{:keys [x y] :as point}]           destructure + bind whole
[[a b & rest]]                       sequential destructuring
```

## Reading checker errors

This is where Beagle pays for itself. The checker output is precise enough
to fix most errors without reading the source.

### E002 — type mismatch

```
── E002 ── shipping.rkt:45 ──
  (carrier-base-rate zone)
  arg 1: expected Carrier, got DeliveryZone
  help: did you mean `zone-surcharge-pct`?
```

**"did you mean X?" is almost always correct. Use X.** Don't second-guess
the suggestion. `beagle-fix` auto-applies single-suggestion errors.

Type mismatch on an accessor call means **you called the wrong accessor**,
not that you passed the wrong variable. The variable is fine — the accessor
is for a different record type.

### E001 — arity

```
── E001 ── billing.rkt:61 ──
  (order-customer-id)
  called with 0 args, expects 1
  sig: order-customer-id : [Order -> Long]
```

Missing argument. The `sig:` line tells you exactly what to pass.

### General patterns

- E002 type mismatch → wrong accessor. Query: `beagle-fields Record .`
- E001 arity → missing/extra arg. Query: `beagle-sig fn .`
- Single suggestion → high confidence, auto-fixable
- Multiple suggestions → you choose from alternatives
- `expected Long, got Amount` → forgot to unwrap scalar
- `expected Amount, got Long` → forgot to rewrap scalar

## Tool reference

All tools are at the project's `bin/` directory.

### Reactive daemon — automatic checking after every edit

| Tool | What it does | When to use |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| `beagle-daemon start --watch .` | Start daemon + inotify watcher on all .rkt files | **Step 0.** Start this before anything else. Re-checks every file within ~100ms of a save. |
| `beagle-daemon query check-enriched .` | Synchronous: full type check + enriched context (JSON) | When you need a fresh check without the watcher. |
| `beagle-daemon query check-result FILE` | Return cached check result for one file (instant) | When you want to peek at the latest result without triggering a new check. |
| `beagle-verify-enriched .build/ VERIFY` | Run verify + auto-diagnose failures with trace/cascade | After `beagle-build-all`, instead of running the raw verify script. |

When the daemon is watching and a PostToolUse hook is configured, you
get enriched diagnostics injected automatically after every file edit.
The output includes error count, fix hints, and record field context —
eliminating the need for separate `beagle-check-all`, `beagle-fields`,
and `beagle-sig` calls during the edit loop.

### Phase 1 tools — auto-fix and batch check

| Tool | What it does | When to use |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| `beagle-fix --apply .` | Auto-fix high-confidence type errors | **Always first.** Handles accessor swaps, single-candidate fixes. 6-8 mechanical fixes in zero reasoning. |
| `beagle-check-all .` | Type-check all files, show remaining errors | After fix, if the daemon isn't watching. The daemon makes this redundant during the edit loop. |
| `beagle-syntax *.rkt` | Fast paren/bracket balance check (<200ms) | **After every edit session.** Catches unmatched delimiters before you waste a compile cycle. |

### Phase 2 tools — compile and verify

| Tool | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `beagle-build-all *.rkt --out .build/` | Compile all files to Clojure |
| `beagle-verify-enriched .build/ VERIFY` | Run verify + auto-diagnose with trace and cascade |

### Phase 3 tools — diagnose verify failures

These tools analyze behavioral failures (assertions that fail after the
code compiles and runs). `beagle-verify-enriched` calls them
automatically, but you can use them directly for targeted analysis.

| Tool | What it does | When to use |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| `beagle-repair . VERIFY` | Unified pipeline: type check + blame + specfix → ranked repair queue | When you have both type errors AND verify failures. Produces AUTO (apply blindly) and SUGGEST (needs judgment) items. |
| `beagle-repair . VERIFY --emit-patch` | Same but outputs a unified diff to stdout | Pipe to `git apply`. Eliminates ~6 mechanical fixes in one command before you start reasoning. |
| `beagle-trace .build/ VERIFY` | Per-assertion arithmetic trace showing exact divergence | When a verify assertion fails and you can't see why. Shows the full computation chain and where the value first went wrong. |
| `beagle-trace .build/ VERIFY --focus fn-name` | Trace filtered to one function | When you know which function is wrong but not which operation. |
| `beagle-cascade . VERIFY --from-failures` | Root cause analysis across call graph | When 5+ assertions fail. Often one upstream bug causes 3-5 downstream failures. Fix the root, not the symptoms. |
| `beagle-blame .build/ VERIFY` | Ratio analysis (sign error, wrong operator) | Quick triage. Usually subsumed by `beagle-repair`. |

### Query tools — replace file reads

These are faster and more reliable than reading source files. With the
reactive daemon, record field context is already included in error
output. Use these for ad-hoc lookups.

| Tool | What it does | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `beagle-sig fn-name .` | Function signature | `order-total : [Order -> Amount]` |
| `beagle-fields Record .` | Record fields + accessor types | Shows all fields, their types, and accessor names |
| `beagle-callers fn-name .` | All call sites with arity | Find who calls a function and how |
| `beagle-provides file.rkt` | Module exports with types | Everything a module makes available |
| `beagle-impact fn-name .` | Downstream effects of a change | Before changing a signature, see what breaks |

**With the daemon watching, most query tool calls are unnecessary.**
The enriched error output already includes record fields for the types
mentioned in each error. Use query tools only for ad-hoc exploration
(e.g., "what does this module export?").

## Workflow — the proven sequence

This workflow comes from analyzing 7 experiment runs. Runs that follow
this pattern are consistently faster.

### Step 0: Start the reactive daemon

```bash
beagle-daemon start --watch .
```

This starts a persistent background process that watches all `.rkt` files
via inotify. **Every time you edit a file, the daemon re-checks it within
~100ms.** If a PostToolUse hook is configured, you'll see enriched type
errors automatically injected after each edit — no need to manually run
`beagle-check-all`.

The daemon also enriches errors with record field context, so you see
which accessors are available without running `beagle-fields`.

### Step 1: Mechanical fixes (zero reasoning)

```bash
beagle-fix --apply .
```

Auto-fixes 6-8 accessor swaps and single-candidate type errors. This is
free — it never introduces new bugs.

### Step 2: Remaining type errors

If the daemon is watching, you'll see errors after each edit. Otherwise:

```bash
beagle-check-all .
```

Read each error. Use the patterns above to fix them. For ambiguous errors,
query:

```bash
beagle-fields DeliveryZone .    # what accessors does this record have?
beagle-sig order-total .        # what does this function expect?
```

### Step 3: Confirm type-clean, then compile

```bash
beagle-check-all .              # should be clean
beagle-build-all *.rkt --out .build/
```

### Step 4: Run behavioral verification

Run whatever verify script exists. Read the failures.

### Step 5: Diagnose logic bugs

For each verify failure:

1. **Read the expected vs actual.** Often the pattern is obvious:
   - expected 700, got -700 → subtraction is backwards
   - expected 700, got 7 → missing `* 100` or dividing by wrong number
   - expected 700, got 0 → wrong accessor returning an ID where a value is needed

2. **If not obvious**, use trace:
   ```bash
   beagle-trace .build/ VERIFY --focus function-name
   ```

3. **If 5+ failures**, check for root causes first:
   ```bash
   beagle-cascade . VERIFY --from-failures
   ```
   Fix the highest cascade-score function first — one fix may resolve
   3-5 downstream failures.

### Step 6: Paren check after edits

```bash
beagle-syntax *.rkt
```

This catches corrupted paren balance in <200ms. Lisp-unfamiliar editing
(and Clojure-familiar editing under pressure) commonly breaks delimiter
balance. Run this after every batch of manual edits, before compiling.

### Step 7: Rebuild and re-verify

```bash
beagle-build-all *.rkt --out .build/
# run verify again
```

Repeat steps 4-7 until all assertions pass. Typical: 3-4 build-verify
cycles after the mechanical fixes are done.

## Common bug patterns

In the domain code you'll encounter:

- **Wrong operator**: `+` instead of `*`, `-` instead of `+` (especially in line-total, commission, surcharge computations)
- **Swapped operands**: `a - b` should be `b - a` (especially margin: price - cost, not cost - price)
- **Wrong accessor**: using `product-id` where `product-unit-cost` needed (the type checker catches these — trust it)
- **Wrong comparison direction**: `>` should be `<` (especially reorder-needed: stock is LOW, not HIGH)
- **Wrong divisor**: dividing by 10 instead of 100 for percentages
- **Missing arguments**: forgetting a collection parameter on lookup functions

## Repair agent pool — automatic error forking

After each file edit, a PostToolUse hook checks for type errors. If errors
are found, a **repair agent** from the pool is dispatched to fix them. The
pool autoscales from 1 to 3 agents based on demand. You will see messages
in this format:

### REPAIR_AGENT_SPAWNED

```
REPAIR_AGENT_SPAWNED: agent-a7f3 handling 3 errors in inventory.rkt (step:a7f3) [pool: 2/3]
```

**Action: do nothing.** Continue your current plan. Do NOT investigate the
errors yourself. Do NOT edit the file the repair agent is working on. The
`[pool: N/M]` shows current utilization.

### REPAIR_AGENT_DONE

```
REPAIR_AGENT_DONE: agent-a7f3 finished on inventory.rkt
  L45: swapped carrier-base-rate → zone-surcharge-pct
  L52: added missing argument `zones`
```

**Action: acknowledge and continue.** The file has been fixed. If you were
planning to work on that file next, re-read it first — it has changed.
When agents finish, queued tasks are automatically dispatched.

### REPAIR_AGENT_NEEDS_CONTEXT

```
REPAIR_AGENT_NEEDS_CONTEXT: agent-a7f3 (step:a7f3) fixing inventory.rkt
  Why was the reorder threshold changed? Is the comparison intentional?
  Write context to: .beagle/agents/agent-a7f3/response.md
```

**Action: write a brief response.** The repair agent is stuck — it needs
to understand your intent. Write 2-3 sentences to the response file
explaining what you're trying to accomplish:

```bash
cat > .beagle/agents/agent-a7f3/response.md << 'EOF'
The reorder-needed function should return true when stock is LOW (below
threshold), not high. The original code had > instead of <. The fix is
to flip the comparison operator.
EOF
```

Then continue your plan. The repair agent will pick up the response and
finish.

### REPAIR_AGENT_ACTIVE

```
REPAIR_AGENT_ACTIVE: agent-a7f3 already handling inventory.rkt
```

**Action: skip this file.** A repair agent is already working on it.
Move to a different file.

### REPAIR_POOL_FULL

```
REPAIR_POOL_FULL: shipping.rkt queued (2 in queue, 3 agents active)
```

**Action: continue working.** All agents are busy. The task is queued and
will be dispatched when an agent frees up.

### Key rules

- **Never edit a file with an active repair agent.** You'll create
  conflicts. Move to other files and come back after REPAIR_AGENT_DONE.
- **Don't duplicate the repair agent's work.** If you see SPAWNED for a
  file, trust the agent to handle it.
- **Context requests are fast.** Writing a 2-3 sentence response to
  `response.md` takes seconds and unblocks the repair agent.
- **Pool config** is at `.beagle/pool.json` — adjust `max_agents` (1-3)
  and `model` as needed.

## What NOT to do

These are mistakes observed in experiment runs that wasted time:

- **Don't skip `beagle-fix`.** It handles 6-8 fixes instantly. Doing them
  manually costs 5-10 minutes.
- **Don't read source files to understand signatures.** Use `beagle-sig`
  and `beagle-fields`. They're faster and authoritative.
- **Don't re-run a blocked command repeatedly.** If a tool fails, diagnose
  why — don't retry the same invocation.
- **Don't accumulate edits without checking.** Run `beagle-syntax` and
  `beagle-check-all` after each batch. Catching errors early is cheaper
  than debugging a cascade of type failures.
- **Don't second-guess "did you mean X?" suggestions.** They have >95%
  accuracy. Apply and move on.
- **Don't add `declare-extern` for cross-module Beagle functions.** This
  shadows the real import and causes false errors.
- **Don't use `assoc`/`get`/`update` on typed records.** Use `with`,
  accessors, and keyword access instead.
- **Don't edit files with active repair agents.** If you see REPAIR_AGENT_SPAWNED or REPAIR_AGENT_ACTIVE for a file, move to other files.

## Experiment-specific instructions

### Step 0: Start the daemon with file watching
```bash
/home/tom/code/beagle/bin/beagle-daemon start --watch .
```

### Workflow
1. Start daemon (step 0 above)
2. Run `beagle-fix --apply .` — auto-fix mechanical type errors
3. Run `beagle-check-all .` — see remaining errors, fix manually
4. After type errors are cleared, compile and run verify:
   ```bash
   /home/tom/code/beagle/bin/beagle-build-all *.rkt --out .build/ && clojure -Sdeps '{:paths [".build"]}' -M -e '(load-file "../../verify/e8-full.verify.clj")'
   ```
5. Iterate fixing and re-verifying until all 484 assertions pass

All tools are at `/home/tom/code/beagle/bin/`.

## Module dependency DAG (13 modules)

```
Layer 0 (leaves):     catalog, customers
Layer 1:              inventory (→ catalog)
                      orders (→ catalog, inventory, customers)
Layer 2:              reports (→ all layer 0–1)
Layer 3:              shipping (→ orders, inventory, customers, catalog)
                      billing (→ orders, customers, catalog)
                      procurement (→ catalog, inventory)
                      promotions (→ catalog, customers, orders)
                      employees (→ orders, catalog)
Layer 4:              analytics (→ orders, inventory, billing, shipping, catalog)
                      notifications (→ orders, customers, shipping, billing)
Layer 5:              audit (→ all modules)
```

## Domain semantics

- All monetary amounts are in **cents** (Long). $12.00 = 1200
- Nominal scalar types: `ProductId`, `CategoryId`, `SupplierId`, `Price` (catalog); `CustomerId` (customers); `WarehouseId` (inventory); `OrderId`, `Timestamp`, `Amount` (orders); `ShipmentId`, `CarrierId`, `Weight` (shipping); `InvoiceId`, `PaymentId` (billing); `POId` (procurement); `CampaignId`, `CouponId` (promotions); `EmployeeId` (employees); `NotificationId`, `TemplateId` (notifications)
- Scalar constructors: `(->ProductId x)`, accessors: `(productid-value x)` — wrap/unwrap for arithmetic
- IDs are nominal scalars (not interchangeable)
- Timestamps are epoch **seconds** (not millis)
- Days = seconds / 86400
- Percentages: integer 0-100
- Tax rates are decimal (0.15 = 15%)
- Record accessors: `record-field` pattern (e.g., `carrier-base-rate`, `invoice-total`)
- Cross-module calls: `alias/function` (e.g., `ord/order-total`, `cat/product-unit-cost`)

## Important

- Start the daemon FIRST (`beagle-daemon start --watch .`)
- Run `beagle-fix --apply .` next — it auto-fixes mechanical type errors instantly
- The daemon will show you errors after each edit if the hook is configured
- Use `beagle-repair`, `beagle-trace`, and `beagle-cascade` for behavioral failures
- The verify script has 484 assertions — all must pass
- Repair agents may be spawned automatically to fix type errors — see the pool protocol section above. Do not edit files that have active repair agents.
- When you believe all bugs are fixed, say so and stop
