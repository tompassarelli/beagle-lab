;; E5 Event Pipeline — Commands
;; =============================================================================
;;
;; Command validation and event production. Each command function validates
;; business rules (preconditions) and produces one event if valid. Throws
;; ex-info on validation failure.
;;
;; Business rules:
;; 1. Orders must be confirmed before payment is accepted
;; 2. Orders cannot be shipped until paid in full
;; 3. Cancelled orders release all inventory and refund if paid
;; 4. Customer tier: Bronze (<1000), Silver (1000-5000), Gold (>5000)
;; 5. Inventory reservation fails if available < requested quantity
;; 6. Refund amount cannot exceed paid amount
;; 7. Payment failure after 3 attempts triggers automatic cancellation
